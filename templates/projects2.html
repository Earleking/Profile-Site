                This website is still an on-going project. This project is a statistics site that analyizes game stats from 
                a specific game mode in League of Legends called Twisted Treeline. Hence the name TreelineGG. We scrape the 
                data from Riot's API and store the relavent data in our own database. Then every once in a while our analysis
                engine examines the data and detemines best practices. Both the raw data and the analyzied data will be viewable
                on the website eventually.

                This project is a bot for a popular social program (Discord). It reads the text messages that are sent in the chat
                and if they are sent in a specific format, in this case preceded by a slash(/), then they would be
                interpreted as a command. Using this any user can feed commands to my bot and have it do various tasks.
                Some of these tasks include playing music, searching imgur and reddit, as well as rolling a dice amoung
                other things. This was an earlier project of mine to help me get more familer with Node.js and has since
                served it's purpose and is no longer continued. If I were to want to continue this, I would likely restart
                from scratch because since writing this program I have learned alot about better coding practices and
                in particular better program architecture.

                This project was done at the end of 2017 for the Riot Games API Challenge. The challenge was to create
                a tool that would help introduce new players to some of the newer features in the game using Riot Games'
                API. Me and my partner created a two-part website. The first part was to analyze top players games and how
                they used these new features. We then used this data to help newer players find more optimal uses of these
                features. The other part was a more in-dept teaching section where we detailed what these new features do
                and the strategy behind when and why they are good. My group finished second in our category.

                Hey look! This project is this very site. I made this site hoping to impresses someone who might be
                looking at this site with my web skills. Hopefully I succeceded, maybe not. If I did it would be great
                if you could let me know. Similarly if my website falls flat I would be appreciative if you let me
                know where exactly I went wrong. My design sense isn't the best and I am always learning so if you
                could help me I would love that.

                This website was created in a group of 4 for the Hack Western Hackathon. This project uses machine learning
                along with The Weather Network's API to predict the chances of a flight being delayed on a given day. To
                create this historical flight data was gathered from the past years and then filtered before being fed into
                a basic FeedFoward neural network. Due to short time span only outbound flights were considered with no
                consideration towards the weather at the destination. Also, only USA airports are selectable. Due to The
                Weather Network's API only being available during the hackaton this site is now retired.
