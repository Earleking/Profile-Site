            I am currently in my 3rd year at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada. There I 
            study Software Engineering and am looking for an internship is a software field. Along with programming
            I enjoy martial arts, video games, heist movies and playing with my cat.

        In the summers of 2017 and 2018 I took an internship at McDonald Detwiller and Associates.
        During my first summer I worked under the Missions group and helped with a few projects as
        well as did some scripting for excel. In 2018 I worked under the Software group and did work
        on interfacing programs as well as setting up a web-portal for one of MDA's programs. From this
        internship I was able to learn a lot about teamwork dynamics and workflow in an engineering 
        workplace as well as I got to apply many of the concepts I learned in school to real-world
        projects.

        I am currently attending Western University. I am now in my third year of Software Engineering. Here
        I have learned a lot more about programming as well as many other skills such as teamwork, writing
        3-D CAD just to name a few. I also attended my first hackaton, Hack Western, here. This hackathon
        really inspired me and since then I have already attended two others.

        For high school I went to Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School. I attended this school in
        the International Business and Technology (IBT) program and graduated on the Honor Roll. At this school
        is where I first picked up programming, in my Grade 11 computer science class. At the time I just learned
        Visual Basic .net but have since also learned a variety of other programming languages.
