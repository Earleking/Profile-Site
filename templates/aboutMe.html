                    For high school I went to Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School. I attended this school in
                    the International Business and Technology (IBT) program and graduated on the Honor Roll. At this school
                    is where I first picked up programming, in my Grade 11 computer science class. At the time I just learned
                    Visual Basic .net but have since also learned a variety of other programming languages.

                    I am currently attending Western University. I am now in my third year of Software Engineering. Here
                    I have learned a lot more about programming as well as many other skills such as teamwork, writing
                    3-D CAD just to name a few. I also attended my first hackaton, Hack Western, here. This hackathon
                    really inspired me and since then I have already attended two others.
