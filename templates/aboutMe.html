            Hello, my name is Arek Fielding. I was born on November 28th, 1998. Currently I am attending Western University
            for Software Engineering. I have just finished my 2nd year of school and am looking foward to my 3rd year. I
            have some experience in web development (I made this site from scratch), and I am also very interested in learning
            more about machine learning. Along with that I enjoy Martial Arts, I have been doing karate for some years and at
            school I am part of the Brazillan Ju Jitsu Club.

                    For high school I went to Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School. I attended this school in
                    the International Business and Technology (IBT) program and graduated on the Honor Roll. At this school
                    is where I first picked up programming, in my Grade 11 computer science class. At the time I just learned
                    Visual Basic .net but have since also learned a variety of other programming languages.

                        In the summers of 2017 and 2018 I took an internship at McDonald Detwiller and Associates.
                        During my first summer I worked under the Missions group and helped with a few projects as
                        well as did some scripting for excel. In 2018 I worked under the Software group and did work
                        on interfacing programs as well as setting up a web-portal for one of MDA's programs. From this
                        internship I was able to learn a lot about teamwork dynamics and workflow in an engineering 
                        workplace as well as I got to apply many of the concepts I learned in school to real-world
                        projects.

                    This project was done at the end of 2017 for the Riot Games API Challenge. The challenge was to create
                    a tool that would help introduce new players to some of the newer features in the game using Riot Games'
                    API. Me and my partner created a two-part website. The first part was to analyze top players games and how
                    they used these new features. We then used this data to help newer players find more optimal uses of these
                    features. The other part was a more in-dept teaching section where we detailed what these new features do
                    and the strategy behind when and why they are good. My group finished second in our category.

                    This website is still an on-going project. This project is a statistics site that analyizes game stats from 
                    a specific game mode in League of Legends called Twisted Treeline. Hence the name TreelineGG. We scrape the 
                    data from Riot's API and store the relavent data in our own database. Then every once in a while our analysis
                    engine examines the data and detemines best practices. Both the raw data and the analyzied data will be viewable
                    on the website eventually.

                    This project is a bot for a popular social program (Discord). It reads the text messages that are sent in the chat
                    and if they are sent in a specific format, in this case preceded by a slash(/), then they would be
                    interpreted as a command. Using this any user can feed commands to my bot and have it do various tasks.
                    Some of these tasks include playing music, searching imgur and reddit, as well as rolling a dice amoung
                    other things. This was an earlier project of mine to help me get more familer with Node.js and has since
                    served it's purpose and is no longer continued. If I were to want to continue this, I would likely restart
                    from scratch because since writing this program I have learned alot about better coding practices and
                    in particular better program architecture.

                    This website was created in a group of 4 for the Hack Western Hackathon. This project uses machine learning
                    along with The Weather Network's API to predict the chances of a flight being delayed on a given day. To
                    create this historical flight data was gathered from the past years and then filtered before being fed into
                    a basic FeedFoward neural network. Due to short time span only outbound flights were considered with no
                    consideration towards the weather at the destination. Also, only USA airports are selectable. Due to The
                    Weather Network's API only being available during the hackaton this site is now retired.

                    an AI to play tic-tac-toe. I also want to improve my proficiency in mobile app development. Sometime
                    soon I am likely to create an application using either React Native or PhoneGap. Anyway, whatever it
