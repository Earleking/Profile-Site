                I am currently in my 3rd year at the University of Western Ontario in London Ontario, Canada. There I 
                study Software Engineering and am looking for an internship in a software field. Along with programming
                I enjoy martial arts, video games, heist movies and playing with my cat.

                        In the summers of 2017 and 2018 I took an internship at McDonald Detwiller and Associates.
                        During my first summer I worked under the Missions group and helped with a few projects as
                        well as did some scripting for excel. In 2018 I worked under the Software group and did work
                        on interfacing programs as well as setting up a web-portal for one of MDA's programs. From this
                        internship I was able to learn a lot about teamwork dynamics and workflow in an engineering 
                        workplace as well as I got to apply many of the concepts I learned in school to real-world
                        projects.

                        I am currently attending Western University. I am now in my third year of Software Engineering. Here
                        I have learned a lot more about programming as well as many other skills such as teamwork, writing
                        3-D CAD just to name a few. I also attended my first hackaton, Hack Western, here. This hackathon
                        really inspired me and since then I have already attended two others.

                        For high school I went to Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School. I attended this school in
                        the International Business and Technology (IBT) program and graduated on the Honor Roll. At this school
                        is where I first picked up programming, in my Grade 11 computer science class. At the time I just learned
                        Visual Basic .net but have since also learned a variety of other programming languages.
